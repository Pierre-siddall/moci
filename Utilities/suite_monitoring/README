INTRODUCTION:
 This tool computes various rates for jobs in running cycling suites. The rates are computed for each cycle, and then interpolated onto a regular set of times which are then processed. This means that irregular timesteps in the original data can be ignored.

TO RUN THE SCRIPT:
 As a simple use of the test to find the data for a coupled job, first find the cycling period of the suite in months, then run using:
 ./suite_run_rates.py -c <cycle_period> -r {summary|interpolated|raw|plot} /path/to/cylc/run/dir/

OUTPUTS:
 There are four rates computed:
 - Effective rate: The time between successive submit points
 - Job rate: based on the time of the job starting and ending. For a coupled job this is the fastest rate the suite could manage
 - Job and queuing rate: The time from the coupled job being submitted and it ending
 - Coupled and waiting: Time between sucessive cycle points with the queuing time subtracted.

 The data can be reported in various ways, using the -r (--report-type) option:
 - summary: a summary of the rates
 - interpolated: prints the interpolated rates
 - raw: prints the raw rates from the suite database
 - plot: displays a graph showing the interpolated data

All elapsed times are in days, and all rates are in years per day.

TESTING:
 The script contains unit tests and a system test.

 To run the unit tests:
 cd unit_tests
 ./test.py

 To run the system tests:
 cd system_test
 ./integration_test.sh
