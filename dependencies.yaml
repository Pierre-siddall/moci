# This file contains a list of all linked external repositories containing code
# and data required to build and run the moci rose-stem
#
# Each section is the name of the repository
# source: Is either the url to the repository (the upstream or
#         a fork) or a path to a local clone with format `host:/path/to/clone`
# ref: Is a valid git reference. This can either be a commit hash, a tag or a
#      branch name
#
# The entry for this repository will have blank values for both source and ref
# by default, which will cause the test suite to use the source code from the
# local clone. These can be filled to set a different source if desired.
