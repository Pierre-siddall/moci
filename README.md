# moci - Met Office Coupling Infrastructure

The Met Office global coupled models (GC) couple together the ​
[UM](https://github.com/MetOffice/um) and [​NEMO](https://www.nemo-ocean.eu/) in
order to create an atmosphere-ocean-ice-land modelling system of the physical
climate model. Moci is also used in the NGMS infrastructure, using
[LFRic](https://github.com/MetOffice/lfric_apps) as the atmosphere model.

The Met Office Coupling Infrastructure (MOCI) is a repository of codes that,
together with ​Rose suites, form the superstructure controlling the execution of
Met Office global coupled models components.
