INTRODUCTION
 This tool will validate the coupling setup of a UM-NEMO coupled model. The motivation for this was the potential of short stepping in a Coupled NWP CRUN, to ensure any coupling paramaters chosen with the shortened timestep remained appropriate.

 The script peforms the following validations:
  - Compare the coupling frequency from the UM SHARED namelist, against the UM
    and NEMO timesteps.
  - Compare the coupling frequency set by the UM against that set in the
    OASIS3-MCT namcouple file
  - Compare the coupling frequency against the (current) two STASH coupling
    time profiles:
      - TCOUPMN - Coupling of mean fields
      - TCOUP - Coupling of instantaneous files. In practice this is currently
                limited to the river routing fields.

TO USE THE SCRIPT
 The script can be included in any UM-NEMO suite, using OASIS3-MCT4.0 for coupling, by exporting the environment variable L_MCT_VALIDATE="True" from the suite. Please note the capital T.

TESTING
 The script has assosciated unit tests. To run them, please ensure that you
are using Python3 and then:

$ cd unittests
$ ./test.py
